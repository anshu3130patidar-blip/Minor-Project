        " The goal of this project is to create a Python program that uses a NumPy array to store the marks of multiple students. In order to determine total marks, average marks, highest marks, and lowest marks, the program analyzes the marks. The program uses conditional statements to determine a grade based on the average marks. This project makes it easier to comprehend how NumPy and Python can be combined for basic data analysis."
